# Jitsi Meet Cursor Rules

This directory contains the Cursor rules for the Jitsi Meet project. These rules are designed to maintain code quality, consistency, and maintainability across the project.

## Rule Categories

2. `architecture.md` - Architectural patterns and system design rules

## Using These Rules

- All new code should follow these rules
- Existing code should be gradually updated to conform when modified
- Use these rules as guidelines for code reviews
- Rules can be updated through pull requests with team consensus

## Rule Maintenance

- Rules should be reviewed quarterly
- Updates require team discussion and consensus
- Each rule should have a clear rationale
- Rules should be specific and measurable where possible

## Enforcement

- Primary enforcement through code review
- Automated checks where possible
- Regular codebase audits
- Team training and documentation
